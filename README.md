Analyzing economic data of Sri Lanka for the period 1960 to 2021. 

The data analysis of this projects was carried out in Python. 

The steps that we applied to the dataset arisen from Kaggle Dataset were the following ones: 

1. Data loading using Pandas Library.
2. Data cleaning (convert data types, take care of missing values, remove irrelevant elements such as %)
3. Data Visualization of comparable measures using Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries.

This is a guided project that was carried out with the guidance of @data_science_teacher_brandyn.
